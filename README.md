# Five Psalms

A flutter app for reading the entire book of psalms every month by reading five psalms a day. 

## About the app

My church showed a video where the speaker recommended praying through the psalms by reading five every day. He shared an app to help with this, but the app is unmaintained and does not function well anymore. This is my attempt to learn app design and create something useful in the process.

The app displays the psalms starting with the one numbered the same as the current date and then increments by 30. For example if the date is Jan 1st, the app would display Psalms 1,31,61,91,121. For April 28th it would display Psalms 28, 58, 88, 118, 148.
